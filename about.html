        <h2> Information</h2>
        <p>Ryzen and the fundamental "Zen" CPU microarchitecture its uses were especially significant for AMD since it 
            was a completely new, "from scratch" design and marked the corporation's return to the high-end CPU market after a decade 
            of near-total absence since 2006. This is because AMD's primary competitor Intel had largely dominated this market 
            segment starting from the 2006 release of their Core microarchitecture (marketed as "Core 2"), after abandoning the 
            Pentium 4's extremely uncompetitive Netburst microarchitecture (with AMD's Athlon XP in terms of price and efficiency 
            and Athlon 64 & 64 X2 basically across the board) for an upgraded version of the prior Pentium 3, which notably continues 
            to underpin Intel's CPU designs to this very day.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Until Ryzen's initial launch in the spring of 2017, Intel's market dominance over AMD would only continue to increase as 
            simultaneously with the above top-to-bottom launch of the now famous "Intel Core" CPU lineup and branding, was the 
            successful roll out of their well known "tick-tock" CPU release strategy. This then brand new release strategy was most 
            famous for alternating between a new CPU microarchitecture and a new fabrication node each and every year; with it being 
            something that over time would become a release cadence they'd eventually manage to stick to for almost an entire decade 
            (specifically lasting from Intel Core's initial summer 2006 launch with 65 nm Conroe, all the way until their 14 nm 
            Broadwell desktop CPUs were delayed a year from a planned 2014 launch out to summer 2015 instead. This would necessitate 
            a refresh of their pre-existing 22 nm Haswell CPU lineup in the form of "Devil's Canyon", and thus officially end 
            "tick-tock" as a practice). And it's for these same exact reasons that this became incredibly important for AMD, 
            as Intel's inability to further sustain "tick-tock" past around 2014 would prove absolutely critical, if not downright 
            essential in providing both the initial and continually growing market openings for their Ryzen CPUs and the Zen CPU 
            microarchitecture in general to succeed.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Ryzen is the consumer-level implementation of the newer Zen microarchitecture, a complete redesign that marked the return 
            of AMD to the high-end CPU market, offering a product stack able to compete with Intel at every level. Having more 
            processing cores, Ryzen processors offer greater multi-threaded performance at the same price point relative to Intel's 
            Core processors. The Zen architecture delivers more than 52% improvement in instructions per cycle (clock) over the 
            prior-generation Bulldozer AMD core, without raising power use. The changes to instruction set also makes it 
            binary-compatible with Intel's Broadwell, smoothing the transition for users.
            <br>
            Threadripper, which is geared for high performance desktops (HEDT), wasn't developed as part of a business plan or a 
            specific roadmap; instead, a small enthusiast team inside AMD saw an opportunity that something could be developed between
             the Ryzen and Epyc CPU roadmaps that would put the crown of performance on AMD. After some progress was made in their 
             spare time, the project was greenlit and put in an official roadmap by 2016.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Since the release of Ryzen, AMD's CPU market share has increased while Intel's appears to have stagnated and/or regressed.</p>
